            <p>One of the multinational corporations actively operating in Canada is 7-eleven Inc. It has 600 plus stores spread through 5 canadian provinces. Currently it is not operating east of Ontario leaving out Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and PEI provinces.Traditionally known as Gas station, these stores are diversifying their product and service offerings. In fact, there are about 25% store without gas stations. Now the store signs read '7-Eleven Food Stores'. These stores are major players in Lottery and smoke and tobacco product outlets. Many services are also provided by these stores including financial services, phone card services, gift cards and other play cards. The business model is comprehensive with many stores lacking skills to handle them adequately. However, corporations believe they are digitally enabled so these should be self serving. Only time will tell if they go sales associates.</p>
